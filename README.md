# Bloom & Wild Product Personlisation Proof of concept

## Overview

This project is a small prototype P.O.C built in react that aims to demonstrate capabilities of `fabric.js` in the context of a personalisation service for greeting cards

## Features demonstrated

- Uploading images
- Transparent "frames" for background images
- In place text editing
- Restricting the movement of objects
- Handling the editing inside and outside with some basic animation between
- Font family change (outside only)
- Font size change (inside only)
- Converting to JSON for the purpose of "saving"
- Loading from JSON for the purpose of "restoring progress"
- Export to image and then to PDF (the pdf rendering will likely be handled on the backend but this just shows some options)

## Running

`npm run dev`

## Tests

Ha.
